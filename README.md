# TicketReminder
The TicketReminder system provides automated notifications for tasks, support tickets, or project issues that are approaching their deadlines or require immediate action. The system is designed to help teams or individuals stay on top of their tasks, preventing overdue or missed deadlines.

### Key Features of TicketReminder:
- Custom Reminders: Users can set up reminders at specific time intervals before a task is due (e.g., 1 day, 2 hours, etc.).
- Automated Notifications: Sends email, SMS, or in-app notifications to the assignee or team members.
- Priority-based Alerts: Highlights high-priority tickets and provides early reminders for critical tasks.
- Recurring Reminders: Allows users to receive repeated notifications until the task or ticket is addressed.
- Integration: Can be integrated with task management systems, project management tools, and customer support software to automatically sync tickets and due dates.
- Snooze Option: Provides the ability to temporarily delay reminders for a certain time if the user needs to focus on another task.
- Reminder Dashboard: A centralized view where users can see all upcoming reminders and tasks that need attention.
### Use Cases:
- Support Teams: Ensure no support tickets are forgotten, and high-priority issues are addressed on time.
- Project Management: Keeps project timelines on track by sending reminders for key milestones or deadlines.
- Personal Task Tracking: Helps individuals manage personal to-dos, appointments, or work tasks by sending reminders before they are due.
